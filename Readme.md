The TIMES magazine releases a list of top 100 most influential people every year. It categorizes these people into six categories, namely, Innovators, Leaders, Artists, Titans, Pioneers, Icons.

The goal of our project is to identify the topics and subjects; the 100 most influential people published in Time magazine tweet about. We would like to find out if a personality only tweets about the topics pertaining to his/her professional life or do they tweet about other topics as well.

Moreover, we would also like to find out if these personalities are more of critics or do, they encourage and appreciate the other people in their professional fields.

Further, we would also like to do find if there is any sentiment pattern across all their tweets and does that sentiment influence people. Also, we would like to compare these tweets with other personalities who are in the same professional field but are not present in the list of 100 most influential people and analyze if there is any particular sentiment attached with them which makes them stand out from others.

Dataset and process:

First, we’ll find out if the personalities listed in the Time magazine are available on twitter. For all those personalities who have their account on twitter, we’ll be scrapping their tweets for the year 2020. We will club all these tweets in a data file which will contain data columns like- twitter handler, tweets, area of work. We will then perform word vectorization to find the words used mostly by personalities in a particular profession and categorize them in positive and negative sentiment.

We would also like to build a word embedding model so that we will be able to categorize the words used in tweets and answer the above questions based on the results.
